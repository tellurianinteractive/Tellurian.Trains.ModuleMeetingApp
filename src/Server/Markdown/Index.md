## Quick Start
Here's how to get started!

### Is this text in your preferred language?
Good. 
If not, you can select your language above.
Then, reload the app in your web broswer.

### Where is the clock?
There are always the *Demo* clock to play with. 
But the *Demo* clock is not used at meetings.

The administrator has usually set up a specific clock for the meeting. 
1. Ask the administrator for the clock *name* and optionally the *user password*.
2. Select *Settings* in the menu, and enter this information, and click *Save*.
3. Select *Clock* in the menu and you will see the meeting clock. 

### Using the clock
You can easy see the status of the clock:
* **Red time**: Clock is stopped, and maybe there also is displayed a reason for it.
* **Green time**: Clock is running. Click *Show more* to see details.
* **Blue time**: Clock is displaying real time and the game is interrupted for some reason.

Sometimes the clock also displays a *weekday*, which may have meaning when to run the trains.
