# Release Notes
## Updating old client
If you get the message **Invalid Client** you need to update it.
The reason is that the version that has been cached by your browser is not longer valid.
To fix it, do one of the following:
- If you run it in a browser you need to do a *hard reload*, 
often holding SHIFT down while refreshing the site.
- If you have installed a previous version on your desktop or homescreen, 
you need to uninstall it and then do a *hard reload* in your web browser to clear the apps old cached data in your browser.
- If you have added the app to the homescreen on iPad or iPhone, 
you must delete website data in order to upgrade. 
You can do this is available under *Safari's Advanced settings*. 

## Keep settings over time
For integrity reasons, some browsers clears its local storage when the browser is closed.
If you want to keep your clock settings, you need to change your browsers integrity settings.

In your brower settings, create an exception for clearing data on exit for the web site *https:[]()//fastclock.azurewebsites.net*.
This will keep your clock settings including your username and selected clock name.
